# Pseudo Code Solution

We create a function that takes in a string. We need to create a new string then loop backwards through the passed in one, adding each index to the new string. We then return it!

function that takes in a string
  define a reversed string variable as an empty string
  for loop - loop backwards, starting with the .length value of the string and going down to 0
    push each character into the new string

  return reversed string
