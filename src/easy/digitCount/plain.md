# Plain English Solution

Given a number, count the number of digits. For example:

```text
318 = 3
92563 = 5
4666 = 4
314890 = 6
```

We would probably need a function that takes a number as a parameter. We would need to loop through that number (perhaps we need to convert the number into an array?) and check how many elements we have.

Easier - convert number into a string and then just use the length property
