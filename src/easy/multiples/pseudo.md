# Pseudo Code Solution

We create a function that takes number and length parameters. We create a new array, then using a loop, we increment towards the length. In each iteration, we somehow multiple the same value and add it to the array. 

function definition, takes num and length params
  define a new array that will store the multiples
  loop from 0 to the passed in length. 
    In each iteration, we need to push a new multiple to our array

  we return the array
