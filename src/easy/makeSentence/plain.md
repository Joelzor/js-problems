# Plain English Solution

Given a sentence, capitalise the first letter and add a full stop to the end. However, if the sentence already ends with some form of puncutation, leave it as is.

We could create a function that takes any string as a parameter. We return the string with the first letter capped ([0] should do) then add a full stop at the end. We could use an if condition to check if it already has a common piece of punctuation at the end.
