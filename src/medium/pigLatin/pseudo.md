# Pseudo Code Solution

function that takes a string
  convert string to an array - split method
  define an empty array

  for loop- through the array
    in each iteration, we push to the empty array - first the rest of the word, then the first letter, then the 'ay' string

  We join the array back to a string

  return the first letter capitalized followed by the remainder
