# Plain English Solution

We need to find the 13 adjacent digits that have the highest value when added together. So to do this, we'll need to loop through the 1000 digit number and perform a calculation for each 13 digits. We'll perhaps need to store a max variable that will hold the 'winning' set of 13 numbers, to be overwritten throughout the loop.
